# Visual C++ for Linux Development

This repo is for discussing existing or new features and for addressing questions related to the Visual C++ for Linux Development extension.

## Bugs and Suggestions
We encourage the reporting of bugs and new suggestions on the [Developer Community forum](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com), this is centralized, better equipped for group voting, and has more visibility.

## Labels
This is your best way to interact directly with the Visual C++ for Linux Development team. We will be monitoring and responding to your questions as best we can. In the spirit of openness we will be tagging issues with the following:

- **feature** – Denotes something that is not yet implemented.  
  - Example:  clang compiler support

- **discussion** – Denotes a discussion on the board that does not relate to a specific feature.
  - Example: Visual C++ for Linux Development is not open source 

Additional tags may be used to denote specific types of issues. 

## Closing
Issues may be closed by the original poster at any time. An issue can be closed if:
- A request is a duplicate of another. The duplicate will be linked;
- Any discussion that has run its course.
