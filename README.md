# Visual C++ for Linux Development

This repo is for the reporting of issues with the Visual C++ for Linux Development extension.

## Labels
This is your best way to interact directly with the Visual C++ for Linux Development team. We will be monitoring and responding to issues as best we can. Please attempt to avoid filing duplicates of open or closed items when possible. In the spirit of openness we will be tagging issues with the following:

- **bug** – We consider this issue to be a bug internally. This tag is generally for bugs in implemented features, or something we consider to be a “bug level” change. Things marked with Bug have a corresponding bug in on Microsoft’s internal bug tracking system.
  - Example: Adding a library in linker command line gets added in middle of linker command instead of end

- **feature** – Denotes something that is not yet implemented.  
  - Example:  clang compiler support

- **discussion** – Denotes a discussion on the board that does not relate to a specific feature.
  - Example: Visual C++ for Linux Development is not open source 

- **fixed** – When possible, we will mark bugs that have been fixed internally.  Unfortunately we cannot say specifically when the bug will hit the insider flights.

- **wontfix** – Denotes an issue we won't be making a fix for.  We will give some reasoning why in resolving, e.g. it could be working by design as see it.  After one week we will either close the issue or mark as Discussion depending on what comes up.

Additional tags may be used to denote specific types of issues. 

## Closing
Issues may be closed by the original poster at any time.  We will close issues if:
- One week passes after the change goes out in a new release
- An issue is clearly a dupe of another.  The duplicate will be linked
- Any discussion that has clearly run its course
